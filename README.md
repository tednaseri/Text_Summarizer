# Text_Summarizer
<p align="justify">Text summarization refers to different methods of summarizing long pieces of text. Automatic text summarization is one of the common problems in machine learning and specificcaly in Natural Language Processing (NLP). This project is an online automatic text summarization tool where it helps to summarize text of articles by focusing on important sentences. The importance of a sentence within a given text can be defined differently depending on applied natural language processing algorithms. As a result, different algorithms will calculate importance of sentences based on their own methodology which leads to different final summaries.</p>
  
# Files and Folders in this Repository:
Machine learning codes for implementation of different algorithms along with Flask web application is provided in text_summarizer.py<br>
Static folder includes two folders: "css" and "templates"<br>
The "style.css" file includes the css file which is about the website interface.<br>
The "templates" folder contains all HTML files of the web application.
