# Automatic Text Summarizer
<p align="justify">Text summarization refers to different methods of summarizing long pieces of text. Automatic text summarization is one of the common problems in machine learning and specificcaly in Natural Language Processing (NLP). This project is an online automatic text summarization tool where it helps to summarize text of articles by focusing on important sentences. The importance of a sentence within a given text can be defined differently depending on applied natural language processing algorithms. As a result, different algorithms will calculate importance of sentences based on their own methodology which leads to different final summaries.</p>
